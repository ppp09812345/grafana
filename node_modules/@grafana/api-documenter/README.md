# @microsoft/api-documenter

This tool can be used to generate an online API reference manual for your TypeScript library.
It reads the *.api.json data files produced by [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/),
and then generates files in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) or
[DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) format.

For usage information, see the
[Generating Docs](https://api-extractor.com/pages/setup/generating_docs/) article from the API Extractor
documentation.

# Extended with some special Grafana extras

When running the tool with the markdown option you can specify two more flags:

- `--hugo` that will export the markdown in a hugo friendly format with FrontMatter meta data included.
- `--draft` that will make the documentation as draft (it will not be visible when running Hugo in production).
